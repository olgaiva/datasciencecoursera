## Directory information
I kept all files and directories as they came from the unzipped file. To run run_analysis.R, you need to be in the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.

## Libraries:
To run this script, you must have tidyverse installed. Tidyverse includes a bunch of useful libraries like dplyr, which was mentioned in this course. Any of the functions which are not from base R have been prefaced by the names of their libraries (for example, "dplyr::")

# How to run:
See directory information note. Put the script into the appropriate directory and set that to be your working directory in R. Then, type `source("run_analysis.R")
run_analysis()` and the function will run.
